## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added

- **Component Architecture**: Complete refactoring to modular component-based architecture
- **Centralized Type System**: All types moved to `reactive_agents/common/types/` for better organization
- **Enhanced Execution Engine**: New `AgentExecutionEngine` with improved task coordination and result preparation
- **Simplified Agent Interface**: Cleaner ReactAgent interface with delegated operations
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event subscription system for monitoring agent lifecycle
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent interface for easy agent creation with `ReactAgentBuilder`

### Changed

- **Major Refactoring**: Restructured entire codebase for better maintainability and separation of concerns
- **Component Organization**: Moved agent components from `agents/` to `components/` directory
- **Import Paths**: Updated all import statements to reflect new file structure
- **Type Consolidation**: Centralized all type definitions in dedicated modules
- **Execution Flow**: Improved execution engine with better error handling and result preparation
- **Agent Simplification**: Removed duplicate code and complex logic from base classes

### Removed

- **Legacy Files**: Removed outdated files and consolidated functionality:
  - `reactive_agents/common/types/agent_data_models.py`
  - `reactive_agents/agents/execution_engine.py` (moved to components)
  - `reactive_agents/agents/task_executor.py` (moved to components)
  - `reactive_agents/agents/tool_processor.py` (moved to components)
  - `reactive_agents/agents/event_manager.py` (moved to components)
  - `reactive_agents/agents/config_validator.py` (moved to validators)
  - `examples/self_improvement_example.py`
