# 🏗️ Core Framework Improvement Plan

## 🎯 Current State Analysis

### ✅ What We Have (Working)

- **ReactiveAgentV2**: Enhanced agent with dynamic reasoning strategies
- **Task Classification System**: Fully implemented and operational
- **Dynamic Reasoning Strategies**: Working with strategy switching
- **Natural Language Configuration**: Functional parser and factory
- **A2A Integration**: Official SDK verified and ready
- **Event System**: AgentStateObserver with type-safe subscriptions
- **Workflow Orchestration**: DAG-style workflow management
- **Tool Management**: MCP + custom tools integration

### ❌ Critical Issues to Address

1. **builders.py Misalignment**

   - Still references `ReactAgent` instead of `ReactiveAgentV2`
   - Missing integration with new reasoning strategies
   - No natural language configuration support

2. **Memory System (JSON → ChromaDB)**

   - Currently using flat JSON files
   - No vector search capabilities
   - Limited memory retrieval and context

3. **Event System Enhancement**

   - Needs official EventBus implementation
   - Better integration across all components
   - Enhanced observability and debugging

4. **Plugin Architecture**

   - Framework not fully modular/extensible
   - Hard to add new reasoning strategies
   - Limited third-party integration points

5. **CLI System (Missing)**

   - No Laravel Artisan-style CLI
   - Manual agent configuration required
   - Limited framework management tools

6. **Type Safety & Structure**
   - Inconsistent type annotations
   - Missing validation layers
   - Framework could be more robust
